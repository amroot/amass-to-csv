# amass-to-csv.py
A very simple script that I quickly tossed together that generates an Excel friendly CSV file from an [OWASP Amass](https://github.com/OWASP/Amass) JSON file.

I'll update this with anything I find useful while performing real-world OSINT tasks. Additionally, I'll update the functions so this can be incorporated into other scrips with ease. 

The [OWASP Amass Project](https://github.com/OWASP/Amass) is an **amazing** project that performs network mapping of attack surfaces and external asset discovery using OSINT.
